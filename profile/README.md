# Privacy & Anonymity in Contributions

Protecting our contributors is a top priority.
To ensure a safe, neutral, and trustworthy environment, we support tools that enable contributions **without revealing your identity**.

## GitMask

Allows you to create **commits** and **pull requests** without exposing your real identity.
Especially useful for developers who want to contribute actively without revealing their primary identity or personal GitHub account.

## Anonymous GitHub

Provides a fully anonymous way to submit **issues**, **suggestions**, or **code snippets** — **no account, no email, no metadata**.
Ideal for occasional contributions or security-related reports.

> **Note:**
> Please ensure your files or binary attachments do not contain sensitive metadata before submitting.

All official project communications are sent with **PGP signatures**.
The current public key is available at:

This ensures:

* Authenticity of communication  
* Data integrity  
* Protection against identity misuse
